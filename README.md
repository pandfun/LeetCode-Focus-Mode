# LeetCode Focus Mode

LeetCode Focus Mode is a Chrome extension that hides problem difficulty and acceptance rate.
<br><br>
These labels often influence how we approach a problem, either making us overconfident or hesitant.
<br>
So removing them creates a more neutral and focused problem-solving environment.
